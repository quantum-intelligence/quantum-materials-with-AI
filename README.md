Quantum magnetic materials

Trevor David Rhone, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute

In this tutorial you will receive an introduction to materials informatics. That is, you will learn how to apply machine learning tools to materials physics. We will focus on guiding the discovery quantum materials using artificial intelligence. We will walk through a hands-on example where you will see and implement your own code.

Learning objectives
- Databases
- Materials descriptors
- Artificial intelligence models
- Supervised learning
- Materials discovery of quantum magnets
